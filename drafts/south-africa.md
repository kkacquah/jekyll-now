﻿#  Common Ownership Self-Assessed Tax for Agricultural Lands in South AfricaIn my second post, I propose a radical resolution land inequality in South Africa, drawing mostly from ideas presented in Eric A. Posner and E. Glen Weyl's book [Radical Markets](http://radicalmarkets.com/).![EFF Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkacquah/kkacquah.github.io/master/images/South-Africa/south-africa-banner-eff.jpg)## The Fight For Economic FreedomThe recent history of South Africa is one of a burgeoning economy and of persistent inequalities. While it is the second largest economy in Africa, it is also the most unequal, as a result of the institutional segregation and discrimination that has plagued the country since 1990. Many compounding factors contribute to the maintenance of this inequality; one of which is the vast inequality in land ownership between blacks and whites. According to a recent [land audit](https://www.agrisa.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/AgriSA_Land-Audit_November-2017.pdf), 29.1% of land by value is owned by the government and individuals previously disenfranchised by apartheid, a demographic that makes up 92% of the South African population. Much of this inequality is the result of laws that prohibited black ownership of agricultural lands outside of the reservations where they were forced to live. Despite constitutionally mandated efforts redistribute the land more evenly amongst racial demographics, progress has been slow, due in part to the government's policy of "willing-buyer willing-seller", through which the government would buy land from white land owners for redistribution. The inefficiencies of this mechanism are to be expected, as it is vulnerable to [the holdout problem](https://sites.duke.edu/urbaneconomics/?p=1088) commonly associated with voluntary land markets. Many within the country, particularly the far-left political party [EFF (Economic Freedom Fighters)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Freedom_Fighters), have expressed dissatisfaction with present land redistribution efforts. The EFF recently put forth a motion for a constitutional amendment allowing for "land expropriation without compensation" and it was passed by the nation's parliament in February. The motion has faced scrutiny from commentators within South Africa and abroad, stating that such a change would diminish foreign investment and threaten the nation's already fragile food security.## The Vickery Commons MechanismThe *Vickery Commons* is a solution to the infamous holdout problem discussed by Posner and Weyl in "Radical Markets". ## Benefits of a COSTThe "Common Ownership Self-Assessed Tax" complements the Vickery Commons and intends to place a tax on wealth that pays for the social cost of (holding) wealth.
