#  Common Ownership Self-Assessed Tax for Agricultural Lands in South AfricaIn my second post, I propose a radical resolution land inequality in South Africa, drawing mostly from ideas presented in Eric A. Posner and E. Glen Weyl's book [Radical Markets](http://radicalmarkets.com/).![EFF Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkacquah/kkacquah.github.io/master/images/South-Africa/south-africa-banner-eff.jpg)## The Fight For Economic FreedomThe recent history of South Africa is one of a burgeoning economy and of persistent inequalities. While it is the second largest economy in Africa, it is also the most unequal, as a result of the institutional segregation and discrimination that has plagued the country since 1990. Many compounding factors contribute to the maintenance of this inequality; one of which is the vast inequality in land ownership between blacks and whites. According to a recent [land audit](https://www.agrisa.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/AgriSA_Land-Audit_November-2017.pdf) 29.1% of land by value is owned by the government and individuals previously disenfranchised by apartheid, a demographic that makes up 92% of the South African population. Much of this inequality is the result of laws that prohibited black ownership of agricultural lands outside of the reservations where they were forced to live. When the African National Congress (ANC) took power in 1994, the set forth a plan to transfer 30% of agricultural lands from to black South Africans by within five years. Despite this ambitious vision, black South Africans had received only 1% of such land by 1999, and many in the country, particularly the far-left political party EFF (Economic Freedom Fighters).
