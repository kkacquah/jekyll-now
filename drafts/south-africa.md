﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿#  Common Ownership Self-Assessed Tax for Agricultural Lands in South AfricaIn my second post, I propose a radical resolution land inequality in South Africa, drawing mostly from ideas presented in Eric A. Posner and E. Glen Weyl's book [Radical Markets](http://radicalmarkets.com/).![EFF Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkacquah/kkacquah.github.io/master/images/South-Africa/Farmers-march-2.jpg)## The Fight For Economic FreedomThe recent history of South Africa is one of a burgeoning economy and of persistent inequalities. While it is the second largest economy in Africa, it is also the most unequal, as a result of the institutional segregation and discrimination that has plagued the country since 1990. Many compounding factors contribute to the maintenance of this inequality; one of which is the vast inequality in land ownership between blacks and whites. According to a recent [land audit](https://www.agrisa.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/AgriSA_Land-Audit_November-2017.pdf), 29.1% of land by value is owned by the government and individuals previously disenfranchised by apartheid, a demographic that makes up 92% of the South African population. Much of this inequality is the result of laws that prohibited black ownership of agricultural lands outside of the reservations where they were forced to live. Despite constitutionally mandated efforts redistribute the land more evenly amongst racial demographics, progress has been slow, due in part to the government's policy of "willing-buyer willing-seller", through which the government would buy land from white land owners for redistribution. The inefficiencies of this mechanism are to be expected, as it is vulnerable to [the holdout problem](https://sites.duke.edu/urbaneconomics/?p=1088) commonly associated with voluntary land markets. Many within the country, particularly the far-left political party [EFF (Economic Freedom Fighters)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Freedom_Fighters), have expressed dissatisfaction with present land redistribution efforts. The EFF recently put forth a motion for a constitutional amendment allowing for "land expropriation without compensation" and it was passed by the nation's parliament in February. The motion has faced scrutiny from commentators within South Africa and abroad, stating that such a change would diminish foreign investment and threaten the nation's already fragile food security.## The Vickrey Commons MechanismThe *Vickrey Commons* is a solution to the infamous holdout problem discussed by Posner and Weyl in "Radical Markets".  The concept stems from a utopian vision by Nobel-Prize winning economist William Vickrey: an ideal economy in which all property is constantly up for auction. In his vision, every capital asset that one could own individually will be mandatorily bought off his hands if another individual is willing to pay the asset's posted value. Vickrey, a pioneer in designing auctions that incentivize participants to [bid their true values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey%E2%80%93Clarke%E2%80%93Groves_auction) presented the Vickrey Commons as a way to insure that no individual sets the sale amount of their asset lower than the amount at which they would actually be willing to part with them. If one were to do this, they would leave himself vulnerable to an opportunistic buyer purchasing the asset at a price less than it is worth (to him). However if prices are not hidden, that is, if prospective buyers know the posted sale prices of all items in the economy, there is no incentive refrain from bidding higher than one's true value; this a problem Posner and Weyl solve by introducing another powerful economic mechanism from another influential economist.## Benefits of a COSTThe "Common Ownership Self-Assessed Tax" complements the Vickery Commons and intends to place a tax on wealth that pays for the social cost of (holding) wealth. Much like the Vickrey Commons, the COST has a simple structure, despite its immense utility. Generally placed on assets with common value, a COST is set somewhere between the turnover rate (which can be thought of as the probability that the holder of an asset loses the asset) and zero. When the tax rate is the same as the turnover rate, an asset holder is incentivized to post her true value as the price of the asset. If she sets it higher, she will pay more in taxes than the expected value of holding the asset. However, like any tax, setting the COST too high would disincentive investments that would increase the value of the asset; as the asset holder does not receive the full return on their investment. The trade-off between the allocative efficiency improvement of the tax (the ability for individuals to trade efficiently amongst one another unrestricted by holdout problems) and the investment efficiency (the of the tax is illustrated in the figure below, from [(Weyl and Zheng 2017)](https://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/Zhang-paper.pdf). In the figure $\tau_{eff}$ demarks the COST level that maximizes social welfare, the "sweet spot" between turnover rate and zero (which maximize allocative and investment efficiency respectively).![SW](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkacquah/kkacquah.github.io/master/images/South-Africa/alloc-invest-sw.png)
