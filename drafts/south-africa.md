﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿# Common Ownership Self-Assessed Tax for Agricultural Lands in South AfricaIn my second post, I propose a radical resolution land inequality in South Africa, drawing mostly from ideas presented in Eric A. Posner and E. Glen Weyl's book [Radical Markets](http://radicalmarkets.com/).![EFF Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkacquah/kkacquah.github.io/master/images/South-Africa/Farmers-march-2.jpg)## Background### The Fight For Economic FreedomThe recent history of South Africa is one of a burgeoning economy and of persistent inequalities. While it is the second largest economy in Africa, it is also the most unequal, as a result of the institutional segregation and discrimination that has plagued the country since 1990. Many compounding factors contribute to the maintenance of this inequ))ality; one of which is the vast inequality in land ownership between blacks and whites. According to a recent [land audit](https://www.agrisa.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/AgriSA_Land-Audit_November-2017.pdf), 29.1% of land by value is owned by the government and individuals previously disenfranchised by apartheid, a demographic that makes up 92% of the South African population. Much of this inequality is the result of laws that prohibited black ownership of agricultural lands outside of the reservations where they were forced to live. Despite constitutionally mandated efforts redistribute the land more evenly amongst racial demographics, progress has been slow, due in part to the government's policy of "willing-buyer willing-seller", through which the government would buy land from white land owners for redistribution. The inefficiencies of this mechanism are to be expected, as it is vulnerable to [the holdout problem](https://sites.duke.edu/urbaneconomics/?p=1088) commonly associated with voluntary land markets. Many within the country, particularly the far-left political party [EFF (Economic Freedom Fighters)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Freedom_Fighters), have expressed dissatisfaction with present land redistribution efforts. The EFF recently put forth a motion for a constitutional amendment allowing for "land expropriation without compensation" and it was passed by the nation's parliament in February. The motion has faced scrutiny from commentators within South Africa and abroad, stating that such a departure from traditional property rights would diminish foreign investment and threaten the nation's already fragile food security. In the rest of this post, I will discuss a resolution for land inequality that avoids the potentially drastic consequences to expropriation without compensation. The ideas below are covered in more depth [here](propertyanothernameformonolopy).### The Vickrey Commons MechanismThe *Vickrey Commons* is a solution to the infamous holdout problem discussed by Posner and Weyl in "Radical Markets".  The concept stems from a utopian vision by Nobel-Prize winning economist William Vickrey: an ideal economy in which all property is constantly up for auction. In his vision, every capital asset that one could own individually will be mandatorily bought off his hands if another individual is willing to pay the asset's posted value. Vickrey, a pioneer in designing auctions that incentivize participants to [bid their true values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey%E2%80%93Clarke%E2%80%93Groves_auction) presented the Vickrey Commons as a way to ensure that no individual sets the sale amount of their asset lower than the amount at which they would actually be willing to part with them. If one were to do this, they would leave himself vulnerable to an opportunistic buyer purchasing the asset at a price less than it is worth (to him). However if prices are not hidden, that is, if prospective buyers know the posted sale prices of all items in the economy, there is no incentive refrain from bidding higher than one's true value; this a problem Posner and Weyl solve by introducing another powerful economic mechanism from another influential economist.### Benefits of a COSTThe "Common Ownership Self-Assessed Tax" complements the Vickery Commons and intends to place a tax on wealth that pays for the social cost of (holding) wealth. Much like the Vickrey Commons, the COST has a simple structure, despite its immense utility. Generally placed on assets with common value, a COST is set somewhere between the turnover rate (which can be thought of as the probability that the holder of an asset loses the asset) and zero. When the tax rate is the same as the turnover rate, an asset holder is incentivized to post her true value as the price of the asset. If she sets it higher, she will pay more in taxes than the expected value of holding the asset. However, like any tax, setting the COST too high would disincentive investments that would increase the value of the asset; as the asset holder does not receive the full return on their investment. The trade-off between the allocative efficiency improvement of the tax (the ability for individuals to trade efficiently amongst one another unrestricted by holdout problems) and the investment efficiency (the of the tax is illustrated in the figure below, from [(Weyl and Zheng 2017)](https://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/Zhang-paper.pdf)). In the figure $\tau_{eff}$ demarks the COST level that maximizes social welfare, the "sweet spot" between turnover rate and zero (which maximize allocative and investment efficiency respectively).![SW](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkacquah/kkacquah.github.io/master/images/South-Africa/alloc-invest-sw.png)The Vickrey Commons and the COST complement one another to deliver significant welfare gains: The COST disincentivizes individuals from setting their posted price in the Vickrey Commons much higher than its true value (as they will be taxed heftily), while the Vickery Commons disincentivizes people from setting their property value lower than its true value (as it puts them at risk of having their property taken from them without being adequately compensated). In addition, the revenue generated by the COST in a Vickery Commons economy could be significantly greater than revenue generated from property taxes today; taxes would be levied on the true value of assets to individuals, rather than the appraisal of such assets which is [generally smaller](dfd).## Is South Africa ready for this Radical Market?A Vickery Commons infrastructure with a COST could be a promising way to manage agricultural lands acquired during colonization in South Africa for a number of reasons. Weyl and Posner's proposal would ensure that the individuals who can generate the most value from the land will receive it, maintaining agricultural productivity, sustaining economic growth driven by foreign investments, and encouraging marketing to previously underserved markets (particularly, encouraging more utilization of lands for housing). In addition, if the COST is paid as a dividend to the community, as a universal basic income, or as a way to pay for free higher education, [another contentious topic in South African politics](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/south-africa-embraces-free-higher-education-concerns-remain), the ill-gotten gains of holding colonized land will be paid back to the South African population. This provides black South Africans sufficient retribution for the socioeconomic inequalities imposed upon them throughout colonization and apartheid. Lastly, the mechanics of the COST align strongly with rhetoric and actions concerning land reform in the recent past; it seems to echo the wishes of EFF leader Julius Malema and of black South Africans who have made claims on land which they previously inhabited.### Welfare Gains From The COSTWelfare gains stated from Posner and Weyl.### Malema's Own WordsGet Malema quotes.![Julius Malema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkacquah/kkacquah.github.io/master/images/South-Africa/Julius-Malema-EFF-300x214.jpg).## Next StepsIn future blog posts, I would be interesting in exploring the feasibility of a using a COST for redistributing land wealth amongst South Africans, and as an alternative to land expropriation without expropriation. I would also like to explore whether COST is in alignment with the South African constitution, and estimate the exactwelfare gains that could be achieved using the mechanism. Stay tuned!
