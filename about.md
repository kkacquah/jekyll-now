_Akwaaba_ (Welcome), readers of my newly minted blog. My name is Kenneth Acquah and I am a junior at MIT, I created this blog to discuss ideas, projects, and commentary I have relating to the three academic fields I hold closest to my heart (and coincidentally the name of my major) computer science, data science, and economics. My main interests concern the intersection of computer science and economics, as well as, using policy tools derived from financial economics to dissolve persistent inequities within human societies. When I'm not coding for work or research, or writing here, I am most likely arguing vehemently about trends in modern hip-hop or training with the MIT Varsity Track and Field team.
